    <h1>About the Founder</h1>

    <p><em>“I didn’t set out to build a movement—I just needed a place to belong. And when I couldn’t find one… I built it.”</em></p>

    <p>It started sometime around 8th grade. That strange, in-between time when everything shifts—bodies, friendships, identities. I remember looking around at the social circles forming, seeing how people seemed to fall into place… and realizing I didn’t. Not really. There were a few people I truly resonated with, but most of the time, it felt like I was watching life from just outside the edge. That’s when I first knew—I saw the world differently. And even back then, I wondered if maybe that difference wasn’t a flaw… but a sign.</p>

    <p>They say like energies find each other—and I’ve seen that play out my whole life. I’ve always found myself surrounded by people who are neurodivergent, people with disabilities, people the system wasn’t built for. And over time, I stopped thinking that was a coincidence. We find each other because we <em>need</em> each other.</p>

    <p>Lately, though… I’ve just had enough. I’m tired of watching people I care about struggle through a world that doesn’t make space for them. I’m tired of systems that reward pretending over truth, silence over struggle, burnout over balance.</p>

    <p>Sure, I can mask enough to function. A lot of us can.<br />
    But <strong>should</strong> we have to?</p>

    <p>That constant pressure to shrink yourself, reshape yourself, hide the truth of who you are—it doesn’t create progress. It creates pain. It creates damage.</p>

    <p>That’s why Auralethi exists. Because it’s time for something that actually works—for <em>us</em>.</p>

    <h2>What Auralethi Means to Me</h2>
    <p>To me, Auralethi is one word: <strong>Humanity.</strong><br />
    Not the version we’re told to fit into—but the one we <em>feel</em> when we’re truly seen, heard, and allowed to exist as we are.</p>

    <h2>If You’re Standing at the Edge</h2>
    <p><strong>Don’t take that step. Please.</strong><br />
    I know how heavy it gets—how tired, how endless.<br />
    But there <em>is</em> hope. And you’re not alone.</p>

    <p>There are more of us gathering every day—people like you, like me. People who feel too much, who think too deeply, who’ve been told they don’t belong.</p>

    <p>But we <em>do</em> belong. And the world needs us—more than it knows.</p>

    <p>Just hold on a little longer. We’re building something now. For real.</p>

    <h2>One Last Thing</h2>
    <p>What I wish people understood about me is simple:<br />
    I really do want to see you.<br />
    Not the mask. Not the version you think I want. <br />
    <strong>You.</strong> All of you. At your core.</p>

    <p>It’s not about me at all. It’s about you.<br />
    And if you're reading this… maybe you were meant to be part of what comes next.</p>
